# PLUMED Masterclass 22.6: EDS module + Coarse-Grained directed simulations

## Origin 

This masterclass was authored by Glen Hocky and Andrew White on April 26, 2022

## Aims

This Masterclass describes how to bias simulations to agree with experimental data using experiment directed simulation.

## Objectives

Once this Masterclass is completed, you will know how to:

- How to bias collective variables to agree with set values
- Develop a deeper feeling how parameters in method change learning efficiency

## Prerequisites
